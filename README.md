# React Props: Pokedex DEMO EXERCISE

This exercise is a Pokemon application (a "pokedex") built with React. It allows you to practice using React components and properties.

1. **App**: The top-level component that renders a single Pokedex component.
2. **Pokecard**: Shows a single Pokemon, including its name, image, and type.
3. **Pokedex**: Provided with an array of Pokemon objects via props, it renders a series of Pokecard components. It also has a default list of Pokemon characters to show.
